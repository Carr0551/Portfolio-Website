          <p class="gutter-2 micro">During my co-op experience at Canadian Geographic, often we got the opportunity to help with the magazine layouts or with choosing the cover image. This time, I was asked to redesign the kids logo. They were planning on releasing a small version of their magazine designated to children. The logo I designed was my own but flowed from the previous design. I was hoping to maintain a similar feel, only enhancing the style and feel to stay current.</p>
