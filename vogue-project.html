          <p class="body-content">Photography plays a huge part in any design, especially a magazine cover. This piece has combined typography and photography skills. I learned a great deal how much the final outcome relies on preparation. Designing the cover of a magazine takes lots of sketching and plenty of testing. Overall, the composition draws your eyes to this material through the use of a bright colour in her lipstick, the flower, and bold text.</p>
