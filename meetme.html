  <p class="body-content push pad-b-2 gutter-2">Hello, I am so thrilled that you are here checking out my website! I know that I can and will be able to help you with any of your Graphic Design needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    Take some time to look through my work; I know it will speak for itself.
    <br>
    <br>
    For me, design is so much more then a pretty color.  It is a way of engaging our world and making it better. Together, we can improve the world around us through design.  If you want to learn a bit more about me and my love for art and everything creative, then keep on reading.

My name is Larissa Carruthers and I will be a creative Graduate at Algonquin College 2018.  First and foremost, I am an artist.  I have been interested in art and design for most of my life. Painting, drawing, photography, I enjoy it all. Not only do I love to put my passion as an artist into work, I also relish the opportunity to work with you the client.
Working to problem solve and come up with the solution that is right for each individual is something that motivates me in a big way.  I also think that graphic design is about being open-minded and willing to chart new territory even if itâ€™s a little uncomfortable.  That is something that excites me.  I do wear my heart on my sleeve, and I know that is what my clients appreciate about me.</p>
