        <p class="">Hello, my name is Larissa. I am a graphic designer based in Ottawa, Ontario. I have been in this field of work for over five years. I graduated from Graphic design at Algonquin College in the class of 2018.

          If you'd like to get to know me a bit more, here are a few fun facts about myself!
          <br>
          <br>
          My hobbies include nature walks with my friends and family, this should, but doesn't always include a dog. If I could live on a porch with a book and coffee in my hands, i'd always be happy. The sound and smell of rain is one of my favorite things, along with knitting and candles. If i'm beginning to bore you, just know, I come from a family of eight, of which I am the second eldest. If you are still interested, please message me and I would be happy to connect with you.
